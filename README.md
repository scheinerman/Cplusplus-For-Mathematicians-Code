## C++ has changed

The files in this repository are an unmodified copy of the files on the CD-ROM that
accompanies the book. The original README notice is in `README.txt`. 

The C++ language has evolved considerably since the book was published in 2006. 
Some of the programs may need to be modified to compile and run with modern C++ systems.
