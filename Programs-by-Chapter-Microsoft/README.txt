The programs in this folder are (nearly) the same as the in the folder
"Programs-by-Chapter" but they have been gently modified for easier
use with Microsoft's Visual Studio by Promit Roy, an undergraduate
student at Johns Hopkins University.

Promit made a few minor changes to deal with unique aspects of the
Visual Studio environment. He also change the suffix on C++ program
files from ".cc" to ".cxx"; the latter works more comfortably with
Visual Studio. He also created VS "Solutions" for each chapter;
Solution files are a way to organize multiple VS Projects into a
single entity.
